<!--  
Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
-->
<!--  
The For Loop
The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:

for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
Expression 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has beenÂ executed.
